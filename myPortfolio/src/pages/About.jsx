                    <p className="text-light">
                        I grew up in the rural outskirts of a western Wisconsin city, surrounded by the warmth of a close-knit family. My academic journey began with a passion of Chemistry, which led me to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Minnesota Duluth. Post-graduation, I moved to the Twin Cities metro area and spent seven enriching years at a small environmental engineering firm, honing my skills and broadening my expertise.</p>

                    <p className="text-light">I returned to academia to earn a Master’s in Public Health, specializing in Industrial Hygiene. This pivotal step prepared me to tackle challenges at the intersection of health, safety, and environmental stewardship.</p>

                    <p className="text-light">My professional path brought me to Target Corporation, where I initially excelled in project management roles. Over time, I transitioned into Agile Product Management, collaborating with technology teams to create seamless and robust solutions that empower team members across our stores and supply chain locations.</p>

                    <p className="text-light">Each chapter of my journey reflects a commitment to growth, innovation, and making a meaningful difference in the world.

                    <h3 className="text-secondary">Hobbies</h3>
                    <p className="text-light">
                        When I’m not immersed in my professional pursuits, you’ll often find me embracing the great outdoors. Hiking, biking, skiing, and paddleboarding fuel my love for adventure and keep me connected to nature. At home, I enjoy tending to our vibrant garden and spending time with Chloe, our spirited chocolate Labrador-German Shorthaired Pointer mix. Cooking and baking are my creative outlets, where I experiment with flavors and craft dishes that bring people together.
